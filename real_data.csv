everything to the RIGHT until the 16th hole, at which point I focused on getting my elbows closer to one another at address, and feeling some
pectoral squeeze, then i missed everything LEFT. Penalties: 1 plugged in bunker face, 2 on par 5 11 drive to the right, 3, slightly unlucky
2nd shot on par 5 16th. Putting took longer, and made better lag putts",

Missed right often with irons, poor control chipping. Had at least 3 bladed chips. Later in the round, my body turn became an issue,
resulting in overly active hands. We also dealt with weather adversity and a local league that completely disrupted our round, and I
did not handle the b.s. well mentally.

that he was very fatigued from a long practice session. 1 outright shank on the 8th hole, 
leading to the only penalty stroke of the round. He said he gained confidence. Conditions started windy, then became perfect.

Points of emphasis were: Posture (keeping butt behind my knees), feeling pectoral squeeze at address, right side bend, lower handle.

2 extreme blow-up holes. Horrible decision for starting line on 2nd shot on 15, and 2 water balls off the tee on 17. Driver also left 
a bit to be desired. Couldn't reconcile my new feel at set up with the driver swing at times.

to get my right hand more involved, but cant think of any holes where I actually drew the ball except for 5 by the lake, hooked but rough caught the ball.
Hit 3 wood off the deck several times, ultimately stood taller with club toe less up, closer to flat. 9 iron went short on 2 consecutive holes
with well-struck balls. Very lucky on 15 barely carrying the water.

Decent approach play, with many iron shots drifting to the right. Eratic/poor greenside conditions made short game
difficult. Putting surface also very poor, contributed to a lack of focus with aim lines. All in all, one of my

good job taking extra club and coming up short less frequently, also good adjustments with wedges focusing on dead arms,
smooth body rotation.
